## Code Explanation
### Gravity Values
The gravitational ratios used for each planet:
| Planet   | Gravity Multiplier |
|----------|---------------------|
| Mercury  | 0.38                |
| Venus    | 0.91                |
| Earth    | 1                   |
| Mars     | 0.38                |
| Jupiter  | 2.34                |
| Saturn   | 0.93                |
| Uranus   | 0.92                |
| Neptune  | 1.12                |

### JavaScript Logic
- The `parseFloat()` function converts user input into a number.
- The weight is multiplied by the planet's gravity multiplier to calculate the adjusted weight.
- The result is displayed dynamically.
